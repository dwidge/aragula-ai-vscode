# Feature Plan: Sensitive Data Masking for AI Interactions

## 1. Feature Title

Sensitive Data Masking for AI Interactions

## 2. Motivation / Problem Statement

Users often submit files containing sensitive or proprietary information (e.g., personal identifiable information, confidential code, internal documents) to AI models. Directly exposing this data to third-party AI services raises significant privacy and security concerns. This feature aims to provide users with a robust mechanism to protect their sensitive information by anonymizing it before transmission to the AI and restoring it upon receiving output, thereby enhancing data privacy and compliance.

## 3. Core Functionality

This feature will implement a two-way, configurable string replacement system for all file content processed by the AI.

### 3.1 Pre-processing (Outbound Data Masking)

- **Interception:** Intercept all textual content from files and messages (user/system) designated for submission to the AI.
- **Replacement:** Before sending, scan the content for all occurrences of user-defined "sensitive strings." Each found sensitive string will be replaced with its corresponding "dummy placeholder string."
- **Transmission:** The modified content (containing only dummy placeholders) is then securely transmitted to the AI model.

### 3.2 Post-processing (Inbound Data Restoration)

- **Interception:** Intercept all textual content received back from the AI (e.g., generated code, summaries, chat responses, or modified files).
- **Restoration:** Before writing to disk or displaying to the user, scan the received content for all occurrences of the "dummy placeholder strings." Each placeholder will be restored back to its original "sensitive string."
- **Final Output:** The fully restored content is then provided to the user (e.g., written to a local file, displayed in the chat interface).

## 4. User Interface (UI) Changes

- **New Configuration Panel:** Introduce a new, dedicated configuration panel or popup within the GUI's settings. This panel will be titled something like "Privacy & Data Masking" or "Sensitive String Management."
- **Search/Replace Pair Management:**
  - Provide an intuitive interface to manage a list of search-and-replace string pairs.
  - For each pair, allow users to:
    - **Add New Pair:** Input both the `Sensitive String (Search)` and its corresponding `Dummy Placeholder (Replace)`.
    - **Edit Existing Pair:** Modify either string in an existing pair.
    - **Delete Pair:** Remove an unwanted pair from the list.
  - Consider advanced options such as case-sensitivity toggles or regular expression support for more flexible matching.
- **Global Feature Toggle:** Include a prominent checkbox or switch within the new panel to enable or disable the entire sensitive data masking feature globally.

## 5. Data Storage / Persistence

- **Settings Persistence:** The complete list of configured search-and-replace string pairs, along with the global feature toggle state, must be persisted.
- **Integration with Existing Settings:** This data should be stored alongside the application's existing user preferences and configuration files (e.g., within a JSON configuration file, local storage, or user profile directory).
